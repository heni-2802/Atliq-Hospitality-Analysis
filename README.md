## Project Overview
Atliq Grands, a prominent chain of five-star hotels across India, has been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, they have experienced a decline in both market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. To regain their competitive edge, Atliq Grands has decided to incorporate [Business and Data Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence).

This project focuses on providing key insights from historical data to help Atliq Grands improve their decision-making and regain market share and revenue.

## Problem Statement
Atliq Grands is facing challenges in maintaining its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. The management aims to leverage data intelligence to address this issue, but they lack an in-house data analytics team. As a result, they have hired a 3rd party service provider to analyze their historical data and provide actionable insights.
